# PCG Universe 2.0
A 3D Procedurally Generated Universe, Built in Unity 2019

This project was created as part of my degree in Game Programming from Academy of Ary University. This time in 3D, using Unity. It generates a galaxy, stars, solar systems, and planets down to the surface details. There's a little gameplay inserted to guide you along the path and see some interesting procedurally generated content. 

Here are some of the techniques employed:
- Simplex Noise
- Space Partitioning
- L-Systems

This project is still under construction as of 12/7/2020, so check back soon for a more complete product!
